#THE PLUGIN RESPITORY IS POORLY BUILT. GO TO RELEASES TO GET WHAT YOU WANT

Author: StormCrasher783. Made for site-11.
An SCP:SL plugin that allows people with the propper permission to set players max HP. The usage is setmaxhp <player> <health>.
The permission required to run the command is setmaxhp.use
A reference in the server info is required, showing any kind of credit. ex "Uses the SetMaxHP plugin by StormCrasher783" but it should include my user, and the name.
